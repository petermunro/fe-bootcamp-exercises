# Box Model

## Understanding the Box Model using the Developer Tools

1. In the browser's developer tools, inspect a website's page and find a box-level item such as a `div` or `p`.

2. Locate the box model. (In Chrome, under _Styles_ it's at the bottom; under _Computed_ it's at the top.)

3. Note the dimensions of the following:

	- the content area
	- the padding
	- the border
	- the margin

4. In the developer tools, use the `element` rule to add a new `margin` property, setting the value to `1rem`, and check that the box model diagram changes accordingly.

5. Change the `margin` property so that all four sides have different margins.



## Creating a Box

1. Create a web page containing a `<div>`.
1. Style the `<div>` so that:
	- it has a `width` and `height` of 400px and 300px respectively;
	- it has a margin of 30px;
	- it has 10px of padding.
